#### History

Genboy started as a game programmer;

The [Festival plugin](https://genboy.net/minecraft/festival/) was a complete [5 star rated project](https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/Festival) created as an exercise in concept development, [game development](https://github.com/genboy/Festival#create-areas-manage-flags-and-run-commmands-attachted-to-area-events) and [php programming](https://github.com/genboy/Festival). The project was shared on [poggit.pmmp.io]([https://poggit.pmmp.io](https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/Festival)) including a [visual manual](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/71c79417556cce34029bd198fa19c7f83d8748da4ef0af5aff6ed55fccdbf13c/68747470733a2f2f67656e626f792e6e65742f6d696e6563726166742f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30312f666573746976616c5f75736167655f76322e312e322e706e67), [ingame commands](https://github.com/genboy/Festival#festival-manager-menu) as well as a complete [interfacemenu](https://github.com/genboy/Festival#festival-menu), translated into 5 languages (english + dutch, russian, french, spanish and polish) with help from other Festival enthousiasts.

The project was halted due to professional commitments that did not leave enough time to keep up with the changes in the Pocketmine-MP coding community.

Thank you Pocketmine MP creators (Dylan!) and all other community members for sharing fun and knowledge!
